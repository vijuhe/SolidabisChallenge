# Solidabis Challenge
My answer to the Solidabis code challenge https://koodihaaste.solidabis.com/.  
The idea is to find Finnish sentences among ciphered sentences where sentences are either Finnish or nonsense.  
The application is a console application that writes the sentence split to text files instead of a web application.
